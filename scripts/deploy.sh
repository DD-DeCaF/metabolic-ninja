# Redeployment of metabolic-ninja requires threading a bit more carefully than normally,
# to make sure that workers stop and terminate before the RabbitMQ broker disconnects.
# First terminate the workers. Since the grace period is fairly short, they will likely
# get killed and not complete the jobs. RabbitMQ will note that workers with any
# unacknowledged messages have disconnected, and requeue those messages when workers
# come back up. Then soft redeploy the rabbitmq web pod as usual. Finally, redeploy the
# workers with the new version. Any existing jobs will be rescheduled and started from
# scratch.
